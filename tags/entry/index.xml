      <description>We design an experiment in which subjects decide between a risky option that evolves according to an autoregressive process, or a risk-free investment. The treatments vary the information displayed of the risky investment after players opted for the risk-free alternative. In the public information treatment, which captures the information structure of index funds, subjects stay longer out of the risky market, compared to the private information environment, present in private equity. This different behavior across treatments can be explained by the demand for information, which overcomes risk aversion.</description>
