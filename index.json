    "summary": "We conduct a principal-agent experiment and demonstrate that a monopolist agent protects the interest of a (robotized) principal better than when three agents compete to provide a service (project recommendation). The agents have perfect information regarding project types and can provide either positive or negative recommendations (continue/stop). An agent can increase revenues only via a positive project recommendation to the principal, who always trusts the agent. The insight from our experiment can be applied to a number of financial environments (e.g. money-managers and rating agencies) and provides additional evidence on how market structure shapes individual incentives and affects equilibrium outcomes.",

The numerical solution to the partial differential equation that governs the evolution of prices shows that the stationary equilibrium is not a Nash Equilibrium and that it differs from the cyclical behavior predicted by another family of dynamics, such as replicator and logit, in a continuous action space",

We investigate how endogenous impacts affect price stability and mispricing relative to the fundamental price. Our results suggest that endogenous impacts can destabilize markets when impacts are quite sensitive to forecast accuracy: Price dispersion increases compared to the baseline treatment where impacts are constant and independent of forecast accuracy. On the other hand, mispricing can be reduced when markets are relatively stable and impacts are moderately sensitive to forecast accuracy.\nPDF\n",

    "summary": "We apply standard evolutionary dynamics to study trader participation in three competing market formats call market (CM), posted offer (PO) and decentralized market (DM). In our framework, heterogeneous buyers and sellers seek to transact a homogeneous good, which can be done by allocating their time among three different market formats.  Our results show that (i) the final participation of traders in the CMis much higher, (ii) the PO can coexist with the CM, (iii) the DM unravels when competing against CM and (iv) the DM can coexist with the PO, depending on the initial participation conditions. Thus, we demonstrate that agent-based simulations are sufficient to achieve some of the previously known theoretical results, while examining abroad menu of formats, including those used most frequently in 21st century markets",
