The agents have perfect information regarding project types and can provide either positive or negative recommendations (continue/stop). An agent can increase revenues only via a positive project recommendation to the principal, who always trusts the agent. The insight from our experiment can be applied to a number of financial environments (e.g. money-managers and rating agencies) and provides additional evidence on how market structure shapes individual incentives and affects equilibrium outcomes.","tags":null,"title":"Does competition aggravate moral hazard?

In our framework, heterogeneous buyers and sellers seek to transact a homogeneous good, which can be done by allocating their time among three different market formats.  Our results show that (i) the final participation of traders in the CMis much higher, (ii) the PO can coexist with the CM, (iii) the DM unravels when competing against CM and (iv) the DM can coexist with the PO, depending on the initial participation conditions. Thus, we demonstrate that agent-based simulations are sufficient to achieve some of the previously known theoretical results, while examining abroad menu of formats, including those used most frequently in 21st century markets","tags":null,"title":"Evolution of markets a simulation with centralized, posted offer and decentralized formats Journal of Evolutionary Economics, 2018","type":"publication"}]
